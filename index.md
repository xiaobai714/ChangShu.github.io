My research is in Natural Language Processing (NLP) — a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence — and the goal of NLP is to develop computational models to understand human languages. There are a host of NLP applications that are commonly used in our everyday lives: Social Media Processing (e.g. Early Rumour Detection) and Natural Language Generation (e.g. Siri) are two examples. A common theme of my research is that it involves building computational models in an supervised or self-supervised setting. My research is generally guided by a diverse flavour of applications, e.g. Entity Relation Extraction, lexical semantics, text generation and misinformation detection. Also, multi-modal is my reseach insterests as well, which combined images and texts. (e.g. Cross-modal Retrivial, Multi-modal Summarization).
